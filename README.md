# usbrelayGUI
A new GUI for the 5V usb relays that you can purchase off ebay.

This was built for two reasons:
  1. The supplied GUI has no timer function to allow toggling of the relay (i.e. turning it on and then off again automatically.)
  2. The supplied GUI did not work for multiple relay outputs, as it relied upon each relay having a unique ID which was often not the case. This GUI allows relays to be controlled seperately.
